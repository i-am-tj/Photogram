# Photogram üì∏

Welcome to Photogram, your go-to platform for sharing photos with a unique twist! Imagine Instagram meets Amazon, where users can share their photos and tag products, incorporating affiliate referral links to Amazon, Flipkart, or in-house products they can sell. 

## Overview üåü

Photogram is a microservices-based project designed to provide a seamless experience for users to share photos and monetize their content through affiliate marketing. At its core, Photogram consists of several microservices:

### Microservices:
- **User Management Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Password Reset Service**: Allows users to securely reset their passwords.
- **Email Verification Service**: Ensures email addresses are verified for account security.
- **Post Service**: Manages the creation, editing, and deletion of user posts.
- **Feed Service**: Generates personalized feeds for users based on their preferences and activity.

üî® **Work in Progress:** The microservices for Photogram are still under development!

### Infrastructure Components:
- **Spring Authorization Server**: Provides secure OAuth 2.0 authorization for the microservices.
- **Spring Discovery Service (Eureka Server)**: Enables service discovery and registration within the microservices architecture.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Acts as an API gateway, routing requests to the appropriate microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns such as authentication and rate limiting.
